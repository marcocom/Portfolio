        "Article": "This client required a targeted promotion that could synergize their years of in-house market research and customer base, our early-era usability testing, and their in-house technical resources to build the JCPenney online identity. Our team was challenged with frequent design changes to account for the client's in-house user testing results during development of the site. The final design used a very light and fast navigation system that allowed wide variability per section to allow for more of the bandwidth consumption to the larger and higher quality photographs and to enable the technical capability of the sophisticated custom software package they had developed in house. I was involved in look and feel establishment and concept for the site, with special attention to the women's, men's, and features section of this very large website.",
