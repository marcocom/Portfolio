The eDeluxe project was built and designed exclusively for a European marketplace that connected users in buying and selling of goods in much the way that Ebay does in the USA however targeted to a higher level of transaction like collectible cars, houses and Art. The look and feel of the site promote a sense of refined taste and elegance in a way that our studies of European markets tended to dictate in our research and discovery.  User Interface principles had to be heavily relied upon yet be tastefully concealed within the folds of the design for thorough server-side customizability.",
