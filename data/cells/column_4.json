The overall look and feel is airy and clean and achieved the client?s expectations by suggesting a desirable lifestyle to the user. This project was also delivered on an extremely tight schedule of about 8 weeks for both design and development.",

Using the latest FLV streaming techniques, the user experience is carefully loaded with control over the information-needs of visiting users and then delivers a user-driven video and still-photo introduction to each of the five vehicles.  This both was a way for me to repurpose the available very-rough footage that the client already had, and also help consumers identify the vehicle to the vehicles name.",
